# AI Essentials: The Administrative Co-Pilot
### *Operational Efficiency & Data Safety for the Modern Library*

**Duration:** 3 Hours | **Format:** In-Person, Hands-on | **Level:** Beginner | **Fee:** $5,000 (**50%** introductory discount applied. Plus the workshop will be recorded for re-watching)

### **The Executive Summary**
Your staff are likely already using AI. The question is: **Are they using it safely, and is it actually saving them time?**

This workshop is **not a generic "Tech 101" webinar**. It is a strategic intervention customized specifically for the public library environment. We move staff beyond the inefficient **"Prompt & Pray"** method—typing vague requests and hoping for the best—to a structured, policy-compliant workflow that turns AI into a reliable administrative assistant.

### **The Customization Difference**
Unlike standard corporate training, this curriculum is **tailored to the daily reality of library work**. We do not use generic examples; we work with **your** contexts:
*   **Real Scenarios:** We practice on *actual* library policies, *real* patron complaint archetypes, and *authentic* grant report structures.
*   **Monday-Ready:** Participants leave with a "Prompt Library" they can use the very next morning at the circulation desk or in the back office.
*   **Domain Specific:** We address the unique ethical constraints of the library profession (privacy, intellectual freedom) that generic AI courses ignore.

### **Strategic ROI**
*   **Mitigate Risk:** Establish a "Privacy First" culture where staff know exactly how to strip PII (Personally Identifiable Information) *before* engaging with AI.
*   **Recover Staff Hours:** Shift 5-10 hours of weekly administrative drudgery (meeting minutes, policy summaries, routine emails) to automation.
*   **Standardize Quality:** Ensure every branch communicates with the same tone, empathy, and clarity, regardless of which staff member drafts the message.

### **Core Competencies**
1.  **Data Defense:** We drill the difference between a "prediction engine" and a "truth engine," ensuring staff never rely on unverified AI outputs for critical reference work.
2.  **The CLEAR Framework:** We replace the frustration of **"arguing with the robot"** with a management framework. Staff learn to direct AI like a junior employee—providing context, constraints, and clear criteria.
3.  **Operational Triage:** We identify the high-volume, low-value tasks (e.g., summarizing 3-page policies into 5 bullet points) that drain staff energy and automate them immediately.

### **Workshop Agenda ** 
> *can be be adjusted after the pre-workshop meeting if desired*
*   **Part 1: The Compliance Layer (45 mins)**
    *   *The "Black Box" Reality:* Why we never paste patron barcodes or names into public tools.
    *   **Protocol Lab:** *The Anonymizer* — Staff practice a rigorous "Redaction Checklist" on mock patron complaints, ensuring zero data leakage.
*   **Part 2: The Efficiency Layer (1 Hour)**
    *   *Ending the "Prompt & Pray" Cycle:* Why bad prompts waste paid time.
    *   **Workflow Lab:** *The Policy Translator* — Instantly converting dense legal/policy text into accessible, 5th-grade reading level summaries for the public.
    *   **Skill Building:** *The Empathy Check* — Using AI to de-escalate internal and external communication.
*   **Part 3: The Productivity Layer (1.25 Hours)**
    *   *Management Strategy:* Learning to "manage" the output rather than rewriting it manually.
    *   **Action Lab:** *Meeting Minutes Wizard* — Transforming messy, unstructured notes into clear Action Items and Agendas in seconds.
    *   **Demo:** *The Grant Narrative* — Accelerating funding requests by turning bulleted stats into persuasive narratives.

### **Who Should Attend**
To maximize the impact on your library’s operations, we recommend a cross-functional mix of staff:
*   **Administrative Leaders:** To streamline board reporting, internal memos, and strategic planning documents.
*   **Public-Facing Staff:** To equip them with tools for de-escalation, clearer policy explanation, and faster email correspondence.
*   **Programming & Outreach Specialists:** To accelerate the production of marketing copy, grant applications, and event logistics.

### **Implementation Requirements**
This training is designed for **immediate implementation** with zero additional IT budget:
*   **Low Tech Barrier:** No coding experience is required.
*   **Hardware:** Participants only need a standard laptop with internet access.
*   **Software:** We train on the **free tiers** of standard tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), allowing your library to reap the benefits immediately without waiting for enterprise software approval.

### **The Value Proposition**
> *"We transform AI from a 'cheating tool' into a 'capacity tool,' allowing your team to stop fighting with formatting and start focusing on community impact."*
