# AI Business Process Automation: Workflow Elevation
### *Building the "Elevator" for Your Library's Routine Tasks*

**Duration:** 4-5 Hours | **Format:** In-Person, Hands-on | **Level:** Intermediate

### **The Executive Summary**
Your staff are capable of high-level strategic work, but they are often stuck taking the stairs—spending hours on manual data entry, formatting, and routine collation.

This workshop is designed to build an **elevator**. We invite your team to share their specific administrative bottlenecks *before* the workshop. We then teach them how to insert AI as an "engine" to handle the heavy lifting—sorting data, drafting reports, and organizing inputs—so that your staff can step in strictly for the final, high-value **Expert Review**.

### **The "Human-in-the-Loop" Methodology**
Automation in a library context must be responsible. We emphasize a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** architecture for every workflow:
1.  **The Input:** Staff collect the raw materials (surveys, stats, notes).
2.  **The AI Engine:** The AI performs the draft work (categorization, summarization, formatting).
3.  **The Expert Review:** Staff apply their professional judgment to review, correct, and approve the final output. *We never let the robot push "Send."*

### **The Customization Difference (Zero-Risk Approach)**
This is not a generic training session; it is a **working lab** tailored to your library's specific needs, but designed with **absolute data safety**:
*   **The Workflow Wishlist:** Prior to the workshop, we survey your leadership to identify "Top Admin Headaches."
*   **Mirrored Mock Data:** Our instructors take your specific workflows and generate **safe, anonymized "Mock Data"** for the lab. We replicate the *structure* of your messy Summer Reading logs or Board Reports, but populate them with synthetic data.
*   **The Result:** Staff learn to solve *your specific problems* without ever risking a single byte of real patron privacy during the session.

### **Strategic ROI**
*   **Accountability:** We begin with an "Adoption Check" to ensure staff are actually using Tier 1 skills (Anonymization/Prompting) safely in their daily work.
*   **Elevate Staff Value:** Shift staff time from *doing* the data entry to *analyzing* the insights.
*   **Operational Resilience:** Build "Standard Operating Procedures" (SOPs) embedded in prompts, ensuring that workflows run smoothly even when key staff are out.

### **What Your Team Takes Home**
To ensure the training lasts longer than the afternoon, every participant receives:
1.  **The "Workflow Elevation" Handbook:** A physical and digital guide containing the exact prompt chains and troubleshooting steps for every lab.
2.  **The "Prompt Library" Starter Pack:** A collection of copy-paste templates for common library tasks (Meeting Minutes, Policy Translation, Sentiment Analysis).

### **Agenda (Tailored to Your Wishlist)**
*   **Part 1: The Skill Bridge & Adoption Check (15 Mins)**
    *   *Goal:* Reinforcement and accountability.
    *   **Activity:** A facilitated discussion on Tier 1 adoption. What tools have you used? What challenges arose? We do a rapid "Refresh" on the CLEAR framework and Anonymization protocols to ensure everyone is ready for the advanced labs.
*   **Part 2: Taming the Inputs (1.5 Hours)**
    *   *Goal:* Automating the collection and cleaning of data.
    *   **The Lab:** Using "Mock Data" mirroring your real workflows (e.g., messy event logs), we build a pipeline to digitize and categorize inputs automatically.
*   **Part 3: The Reporting Elevator (1.5 Hours)**
    *   *Goal:* Automating the drafting of complex documents.
    *   **The Lab:** Staff build a chain that auto-generates the narrative and stats for a Monthly Report, leaving them to simply review the tone and accuracy.
*   **Part 4: The Consistency Engine (1 Hour)**
    *   *Goal:* Standardizing responses for difficult situations.
    *   **The Lab:** Staff build a "talking points" generator for sensitive topics. The AI suggests the policy language; the Human adds the empathy.

### **Who Should Attend**
*   **Department Heads & Supervisors:** Who need to free up time for mentoring and strategy.
*   **Administrative & Coordinators:** The "power users" who manage the flow of information.
*   **Marketing & Outreach Staff:** Who manage high volumes of community data.

### **Prerequisites**
*   **Essential:** Completion of **Tier 1** (AI Essentials). This workshop assumes staff already know the CLEAR framework and Anonymization protocols.

### **The Value Proposition**
> *"We build the machine that handles the drudgery, so your librarians can remain the 'Human in the Loop'—focusing on patrons, community, and judgment."*
