# AI for IT Data Analysis Workshop Assets

## Objective

This repository contains the complete set of teaching materials for a 45-minute, hands-on introductory workshop on using Generative AI for practical data analysis. The session is specifically designed for a university IT staff audience and focuses on building foundational prompting skills to solve real-world problems, such as analyzing spreadsheet data.

The materials guide a facilitator through a live, interactive "guided follow-along" demo that takes participants from a raw data file to a strategic, data-driven communication in just a few steps.

## Asset Inventory

*   `IT_support_tickets.csv`: A realistic, sample dataset containing a variety of IT help desk tickets. It is designed with a mix of structured data and unstructured text to effectively showcase AI's analytical capabilities.
*   `workshop_prompts.txt`: A clean text file for the facilitator containing the exact, ordered prompts to be used during the live demo. This allows for easy copy-pasting and ensures a smooth presentation.
*   `Prompt_Playbook.md`: A well-formatted, one-page Markdown document intended as the post-workshop handout for participants. It summarizes the key concepts and includes the full prompt workflow from the main demo, plus a bonus example for summarizing project updates.

## How to Use

These assets are designed to be used in a live, virtual workshop setting. The intended flow is as follows:

1.  **Preparation:** The facilitator prepares by having the `IT_support_tickets.csv` file and the `workshop_prompts.txt` file ready.
2.  **Introduction:** At the beginning of the workshop, the facilitator shares a link to the `IT_support_tickets.csv` file and the prompts, inviting the audience to follow along in their own AI tool.
3.  **Live Demo:** The facilitator runs the core of the workshop by uploading the CSV file and using the prompts from `workshop_prompts.txt` in sequential order, explaining the purpose and result of each step. The built-in interaction points should be used to engage the audience.
4.  **Follow-up:** After the session, the `Prompt_Playbook.md` is emailed to all participants as a permanent, high-value takeaway to reinforce their learning.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

This workshop and its assets are designed to teach the following core prompting principles:

*   **Structured Prompting (The R.A.F.T. Method):** Demonstrates how defining a **R**ole, **A**udience, **F**ormat, and **T**opic within a prompt leads to more precise, reliable, and well-structured outputs.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Showcases the power of treating AI as a conversational partner. It teaches users to build on previous responses to refine, calculate, transform, and repurpose information.
*   **Presentation Control:** The final version of Prompt 3 explicitly shows how a user can control not just the *content* of the output, but also its *layout* and presentation for better visibility and immediate impact.
*   **End-to-End Data Workflow:** The entire demo follows a practical workflow, moving from initial data discovery and profiling to targeted extraction, analysis, and finally, strategic communication.
