# **From AI User to AI Architect**

**The hands-on workshop that teaches K-12 educators how to take control of AI, automate their tedious tasks, and get back to creative, high-impact teaching.**

### **Go Beyond "Prompt and Pray"**

Too often, using AI feels like a gamble. You type a request, cross your fingers, and hope for a decent result. This **"prompt and pray"** approach is unpredictable, wastes time, and yields mediocre outcomes.

It's time to replace that gamble with a professional methodology that puts *you* in complete control.

### **Our Solution: A Tool and a System**

This workshop is designed to deliver two distinct, high-value outcomes.

**1. You Will Build Your "AI Charter"**
You won't just learn about AI; you will build and leave with your first **"AI Charter"**—a personalized AI assistant trained to handle your most time-consuming professional tasks. Imagine automating things like:

*   Differentiated lesson activities
*   Modification planning for IEP/504s
*   The weekly parent email
*   Rubric and exit ticket creation

**2. You Will Master the Methodology**
More importantly, you'll master the professional methodology—a transferable skill you can use to build a new charter for any task, any time. This gives you a durable, career-long capability for collaborating with AI.

### **What You Will Master**

*   **The R.A.F.T. Pattern**
    Command the AI with precision. Get the exact output you need, the first time.

*   **The P.R.E. Workflow**
    Act as the architect for any project. You approve the plan, you direct the work, you own the result.

*   **Refining Dialogue**
    Learn to turn a "C+" result into an "A+" by mastering the art of AI conversation and infusing your own expertise into the final output.
