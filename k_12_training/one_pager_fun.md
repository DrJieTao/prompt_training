# **Stop Arguing With the Robot.**

**Brought to you by Fairfield Dolan AI & Tech Institute, in collaboration with Fairfield University School of Education and Human Development.**

### **Tired of the ol' "Prompt and Pray"?**

You know the drill. You type a request into the AI, whisper a little wish, and get back... something completely bonkers. You end up spending more time fixing the AI's work than it would have taken to just do it yourself. The robot is supposed to be helping, not giving you a headache.

It's time to learn the cheat codes.

### **Our Mission: Give You a Sidekick and Superpowers**

You'll leave this workshop with two amazing things.

**1. You Get Your First Robot Intern (The "AI Charter")**
You will build a personalized AI assistant that actually listens. Think of it as a tireless helper you can train to do your most annoying tasks. It never complains or needs a coffee break.

Imagine telling your new sidekick to handle the boring stuff, like:

*   Whipping up differentiated activities
*   Untangling IEP/504 modification plans
*   Drafting that weekly parent email (you know the one)
*   Creating rubrics that don't make you cry

**2. You Learn the Superpowers (The Methodology)**
Even better, you'll master the secret system to build *more* robot interns for any task. This is a skill that will save your sanity and your weekends for years to come.
