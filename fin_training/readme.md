# AI-Augmented Advisory: A Strategic Methodology Workshop

Welcome to the official resource hub for the **AI-Augmented Advisory Workshop**. This repository contains all the necessary materials for participants.

## Workshop Overview

In today's competitive landscape, the ability to leverage Generative AI is no longer a niche technical skill but a core professional competency. This intensive, hands-on workshop is designed for investment advisors and financial professionals who want to move beyond the hype and learn a practical, repeatable methodology for augmenting their expertise with AI.

This is not a theoretical lecture. You will learn how to engage in sophisticated dialogues with AI to solve real-world advisory challenges, transforming your client conversations and analytical workflow. By the end of this session, you will have built a "Co-Pilot" that reflects your unique professional standards and amplifies your expertise.

### Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this workshop, you will be able to:

*   **Master Multiple Modes of AI Dialogue:** Go beyond simple questions and learn to use a full spectrum of interaction patterns, from formal instructions (**R.A.F.T.**) to sophisticated, multi-turn conversations (**Iterative Refinement**, **Walkthrough & Synthesis**).
*   **Deconstruct and Manage Complex Tasks:** Learn the professional **P.R.E. (Plan-Review-Execute)** pattern to break down complex projects into manageable steps, ensuring you maintain full human oversight and control.
*   **Amplify Your Unique Expertise:** Learn the critical skill of **Knowledge Injection** to infuse an AI's output with your own "gold standard" knowledge, ensuring its responses align with your firm's tone, style, and quality standards.
*   **Build a Reusable AI Asset:** Create a durable and scalable **System Prompt**, or "AI Co-Pilot Brain," that codifies your entire methodology, including safety guardrails and your professional protocols.
*   **Innovate with Confidence:** Apply a framework that puts safety, compliance, and human-in-the-loop control at the core of the process, allowing you to leverage AI responsibly.
