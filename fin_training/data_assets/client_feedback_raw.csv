1, The market felt very shaky - wanted to take some risk off the table.
2, I saw a negative segment about their new product line on TV and it just crystallized my concerns.
3, It had a great run and I've learned my lesson about getting greedy. Wanted to lock in the profits.
4, Honestly - my golf partner told me he was selling and it made me nervous.
5, I just closed my eyes and sold it - the stress of watching it go up and down was too much. I needed to just get back to even and move on.
