# **List of Prompt Templates**

## **Module 2: The Three Modes of AI Dialogue (For Demonstration & Reference)**

*   **1. R.A.F.T. Demo Prompt**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a clear, simple example of the R.A.F.T. pattern for participants to reference.
    *   **Template Structure:** A complete prompt with filled-in examples for Role, Audience, Format, and Task, analyzing a single piece of client feedback.

### Template 1: The R.A.F.T. Demo Prompt

*This template is a "textbook" example of the R.A.F.T. pattern. We use it to give the AI a clear, formal instruction when our goal is unambiguous.*

```markdown
**ROLE:** You are an expert behavioral finance analyst. 
**AUDIENCE:** The output is for an internal advisory team that is already familiar with the basic concepts.
**FORMAT:** A simple, two-part bulleted list.
**TASK:** Analyze the following client comment. First, identify the single primary behavioral bias at play. Second, provide a one-sentence definition of that bias.
**Client Comment:** "Honestly, my golf partner told me he was selling and it made me nervous."
```

*   **2. Iterative Refinement Trigger Prompt**
    *   **Purpose:** To teach participants the crucial meta-instruction used to initiate a clarifying dialogue with the AI.
    *   **Template Structure:** A vague initial request paired with the specific command to ask follow-up questions.


### Template 2: The Iterative Refinement Trigger Prompt

*This template is used when your goal is ambiguous or you're not sure what to ask for. It inverts the conversation, forcing the AI to ask you clarifying questions before it provides an answer.*
It contains two parts:
  + Part 1: State your vague, high-level goal.
  + Part 2: Add the "magic" meta-instruction to force the AI to ask questions.

```
I need to analyze my client's decision in the Innovate Corp case for behavioral biases.
Before you answer, ask me as many follow-up questions as you need, one at a time, to better understand my intention and goal. I will tell you when to proceed.
```

*   **3. Walkthrough & Synthesis Setup Prompt**
    *   **Purpose:** To provide the exact text needed to initiate the "Walkthrough" pattern, instructing the AI to wait and acknowledge inputs.
    *   **Template Structure:** A short, clear command setting the rules for the upcoming interaction.

### Template 3: The Walkthrough & Synthesis Setup Prompt

*This template is a logistical command used to start the "Walkthrough" pattern. It tells the AI to stop analyzing and simply listen and acknowledge as you provide a series of inputs.*

```
I am going to provide you with a series of client comments one by one.
Do not analyze or summarize them yet. Simply acknowledge each comment by replying 'Noted.' and await the next one.
Do you understand?
```

## **Module 3: Hands-On Lab | An Integrated Dialogue Simulation**

Template 4 - 6 form a nice *prompt chain*, which is one of the **most important** prompt patterns.

### Template 4: Lab Step 1 - Initiating the Dialogue ("clarify the objective")

*This is the first prompt for our hands-on simulation. We will start with a high-level goal and use the "Iterative Refinement" pattern to have the AI help us clarify the specific steps needed.*

```markdown
I need to analyze the Innovate Corp comments and prepare for a client conversation.
First, ask me clarifying questions to better understand my intentions and background of this analysis, one at a time, until I say 'Proceed.'
```


### Template 5: Lab Step 2 - Transitioning to the Walkthrough

*After answering the AI's clarifying questions and typing "Proceed," use this next prompt to set up the data-entry phase. This teaches the AI how to behave as you provide the raw data.*

```markdown
The objective is now clear. I will now provide the client comments one by one.
Please acknowledge each comment with 'Noted.' and await the next one. Do you understand?
```


### Template 6: Lab Step 3 - Constructing the Final Synthesis Trigger

*After you have provided all the client comments, it's time to construct our synthesis command. We will use the R.A.F.T. pattern we learned in Module 2. **Your task is to complete the template below.** Use the guiding questions to help you decide what to write in each `[YOUR TEXT HERE]` section.*

```
I have provided all the comments. Now, please synthesize everything you have noted.
**ROLE:** [What expert persona should the AI adopt for this analysis? Type it here.]
**AUDIENCE:** [Who is this analysis for? For this lab, you can copy this: "The output is for an internal team of investment advisors."]
**FORMAT:** [What structure do we want for the output? Describe the table and its columns here.]
**TASK:** [This is the core command. What, specifically, do you want the AI to do? Mention the number of themes, what to identify for each theme, and what quote to use.]
```

***EXAMPLE PROMPT - for your reference, do NOT copy&paste***
```markdown
I have provided all the comments. Now, please synthesize everything you have noted.
**ROLE:** You are a senior behavioral finance analyst.
**AUDIENCE:** The output is for an internal team of investment advisors who need to understand the key behavioral drivers behind their client's recent trades.
**FORMAT:** A clean markdown table with three columns: 'Behavioral Theme', 'Driving Bias', and a 'Representative Quote' from the data.
**TASK:** Analyze the provided list of client responses. Identify the 3-5 most common behavioral themes. For each theme, name the specific underlying bias (e.g., Loss Aversion, Herd Mentality) and select one quote that best represents it. Do not add any extra commentary outside of the table.
```

## **Module 4: Hands-On Lab | Knowledge-Injected Synthesis**

### Template 7: The "Knowledge Injection" Prompt

*This is the most important prompt for creating high-quality, personalized AI output. We will provide the AI with both our analytical findings and our own human expertise, and then ask it to generate new content that blends the two.*

```
**ROLE:** You are an AI Co-Pilot for a senior investment advisor. Your expertise is in helping me craft empathetic and insightful coaching questions for my clients based on behavioral finance principles.

**TASK:** Your task is to generate a set of strategic, open-ended follow-up questions for my client, Mr. Chen. To do this, you will use the following two sources of information:

**1. THE ANALYSIS:** This is the table of behavioral themes we identified from the client's comments.
[PASTE THE COMPLETED MARKDOWN TABLE FROM MODULE 3 HERE]

**2. MY EXPERTISE:** These are examples of my preferred style for asking coaching questions. They are designed to be reflective, non-judgmental, and forward-looking.
[WRITE THE 2-3 "GOLD STANDARD" QUESTIONS FROM YOUR BRAINSTORM HERE, OR USE THE SAMPLE ONES PROVIDED IN `gold_standard_questions.txt`]

**YOUR OUTPUT:**
Now, using the specific themes from **THE ANALYSIS** as your subject matter, and the style and intent of **MY EXPERTISE** as your guide, generate three new, distinct follow-up questions I can use in my conversation with Mr. Chen. The questions should be tailored to the identified biases. Do not repeat my examples.
```

## **Module 5: Hands-On Lab | P.R.E. and System Prompts**

#### **Template 8: The P.R.E. "Plan" Phase Prompt**

*This prompt instructs the AI to create a step-by-step project plan before any work begins.*

```
I have an upcoming coaching call with my client, Mr. Chen, to discuss his recent sale of Innovate Corp. Based on all the information we've gathered (the behavioral themes table and the coaching questions we drafted), I need to create a "Pre-Call Strategy Brief" for myself.

**Plan** the step-by-step process for creating this brief. The output should be a numbered list of the distinct components that will make up the final brief.
```

---
#### **Conceptual Tool: The A.C.T. Review Checklist**

*This is the "Review" phase of P.R.E. This checklist is a mental model, not a prompt. Use it to guide your critical thinking and ensure the AI's plan is sound before you proceed.*

**The A.C.T. Review Checklist:**

*   **A - ACCURATE & ALIGNED?** (Does it match the facts and the goal?)
*   **C - COMPLETE & COHERENT?** (Are there missing steps? Does it flow logically?)
*   **T - TRUSTWORTHY & SAFE?** (Does it risk giving advice or being unprofessional?)

---
#### **Command Guide: The P.R.E. "Execute" Phase**

*This is a reference guide for the commands you will use during the interactive "Execute" phase. Type these commands as needed to control the AI's step-by-step progress.*

**To have the AI execute the first or a specific step, use:**
`Please execute Step 1.`

**To approve a completed step and move to the next one, use:**
`Proceed.`

**To request a change before proceeding, state your feedback directly:**
`Wait. For that step, please make the tone more empathetic. Revise it, then proceed.`

---
#### **ADVANCED TECHNIQUE (For Facilitator Demo & Self-Study)**

#### **Template 9: The AI-Assisted Review**

*This advanced prompt instructs the AI to adopt a critical persona and use our A.C.T. checklist to find flaws in its own plan.*

```
Thank you for the plan. Before we proceed, I need you to help me review it.

**New Role:** You are now my firm's Chief Risk Officer. You are skeptical, detail-oriented, and your primary concern is ensuring every plan is safe, complete, and effective.

**Your Task:** Critically review the step-by-step plan you just provided me. Use the **A.C.T. Review Checklist** below as your framework. For each point in the checklist, provide a one-sentence assessment of the plan and identify any potential weaknesses or areas for improvement.

**A.C.T. Review Checklist:**
-   A - Accurate & Aligned?
-   C - Complete & Coherent?
-   T - Trustworthy & Safe?

Please provide your review.
```
